Noddy is a tiny local nodejs webserver.

It is available on npm at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lucsan/noddy

You might like to add this to your package.json scripts
"noddy": "cd ./node_modules/@lucsan/noddy/ && node wave.js"
or move the noddy folder to be the webroot. (You could also re-route the portal folder)

Launch Noddy on the command line with: node wave.js

It is intended as an out-of-the-box, local dev, quick and dirty way to test or run php scripts on a node server.

It can run any kind of script, but it only configured for php and javascript.

It requires nodejs to be installed.

To run php, php-cli needs to be installed.

This is a minimalistic server, the intent being to have a fast, small footprint webserver
primarily to test php and javascript code, however with minor modification it could run bash, python etc,
basically anything on your system which can be shelled out to.

WARNING: ATM Noddy is not optimized for anything and is not suitable for commercial use or use in production.

Any resemblance to characters or people real or fictional, living, dead or undead,
is purely coincidental, even if they do have a blue hat with a bell on it.
Isn't that right Big Ears?
