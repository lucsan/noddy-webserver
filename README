Noddy is a tiny local nodejs webserver.

Launch Noddy with: node wave.js

It is intended as an out-of-the-box, local dev, quick and dirty way to test or run php scripts.

It requires nodejs to be installed.

To run php, php-cli needs to be installed.

This is a minimalistic server, the intent being to have a fast, small footprint webserver
primarily to test php code, however with minor modification it could run bash, python etc,
basically anything on your system which can be shelled out to.

ATM Noddy is not optomised for anything and is not suitable for commercial use or use in production.
